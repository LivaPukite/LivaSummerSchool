### _**How to run tests?**_

Every test will be as single unit...But in some tests like full-flow test, there will be inside already 6 parts.  
I tested on browser Google chrome, but you can try on different.
There are tests which I have not finished (dashboardOrders and discountCode) but I really like them so in future I will fix them.

### _**P.S.**_

I really love to work with these tests and I have learned more than my university teached me in 3 full years.
